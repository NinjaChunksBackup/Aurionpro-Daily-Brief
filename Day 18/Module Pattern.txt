Module Pattern

The Module Pattern in JavaScript is a design pattern used to encapsulate code into reusable, private, and public parts.

It's especially useful for organizing code, avoiding polluting the global scope, and creating private variables/methods.



Key Concepts of the Module Pattern

Encapsulation: Hide internal implementation details.

Privacy: Keep some variables/functions private.

Public API: Expose only necessary methods to the outside world.

Is great for organizing large codebases.

Why Use It?

Prevents polluting the global scope

Allows private variables and methods

Easy to structure code in components

Improves maintainability and security



(function() {
    // The private variables or functions goes here.


    return {
        // We return the variables or functions here.
    }


})();
