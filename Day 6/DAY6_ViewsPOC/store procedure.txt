store procedure in sql

A stored procedure is like a pre-written set of instructions stored in the database.
You can use it whenever you want, instead of writing the same SQL code again and again.

📌 Key Features of Stored Procedures:

Stored in the database.

Executed using the CALL or EXEC command.

Can take input, output, or input-output parameters.

Supports conditional logic (IF, CASE, WHILE).

You can call or run it anytime to perform a task (like get data, insert something, update a table, etc.).

syntax :

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (IN param1 datatype, OUT param2 datatype)
	BEGIN
    		-- SQL statements
	END //

DELIMITER ;


there are three parameters in stored procedure

1 -> IN parameter
	
	You give a value to the procedure.

	The procedure uses it, but doesn't return anything back.

	 Example:
		You tell the procedure:
		“This is the student ID. Go find the student.”

2 -> OUT parameter

	You don’t give a value, but the procedure gives you something back.

	 Example:
		You tell the procedure:
		“Tell me how many students are in the table.”

3 -> INOUT parameter 

	You give a value. The procedure changes it and gives it back.

	 Example:
	       You tell the procedure:
	       “This number is 5. Please double it and return.”
